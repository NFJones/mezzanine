# Agent shell

## Purpose

Use the pane-local agent prompt, its common controls, and its safe operating
boundaries.

## Prerequisites

Complete [Getting started](../getting-started/README.md) and authenticate a
provider for model-backed work.

## Open and use the prompt

Press `Ctrl+A a` to show or hide the agent shell for the focused pane. The
agent conversation and prompt replace the visible pane surface, but the process
screen remains retained and is restored unchanged when the agent shell closes.
While the prompt is visible, input for that pane goes to the agent shell;
hiding it asks an in-progress agent task to stop before returning input to the
process. The agent works from the pane working directory, its conversation
state, configured instructions, and explicit action results; it does not
passively receive your full terminal screen, scrollback, or other panes.

Type a request and press Enter. `Ctrl+V` pastes host clipboard text into the
editable prompt while preserving multiline text. Prompt completion supports
slash commands, `$` skills, `#` macros, and `@` MCP server names where enabled.

Common controls are `/help`, `/status`, `/model`, `/approval`, `/new`,
`/resume`, and `/stop`. Use `/plan on` to enable pane-local plan-only mode;
it applies to subsequent turns until `/plan off` (or `/plan toggle`) disables
it. While enabled, the pane has no write sandbox scopes. Use `/plan status` to
inspect the current mode.

## Review actions and context

The agent may request file reads, bounded commands, patches, configured MCP
calls, or scoped subagent work. Shell, network, destructive, configuration,
and some MCP actions can require approval. Approval policy does not itself
confine a permitted process; sandboxing is a separate boundary.

Put repository-specific instructions in `AGENTS.md`. Project configuration
overlays under `.mezzanine/config.toml`, `.mezzanine/config.yaml`,
`.mezzanine/config.yml`, or `.mezzanine/config.json` remain pending until
explicitly trusted. Inspect trust with `mez sandbox trust list` before trusting
an unfamiliar root.
